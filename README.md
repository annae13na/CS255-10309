## CS 255 Module Eight Journal – Reflection 

### 1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a private driver’s education company that wanted to modernize how students prepare for their driving exams. The client asked for a secure, web-based system where students could schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. Administrators and instructors would also use the system to manage schedules, lesson packages, and DMV updates.


### 2. What did you do particularly well?
I think I did especially well when it came to gathering the client’s requirements and organizing them clearly in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). I also made sure my UML diagrams, like the use case, activity, and class diagrams—were neat and easy to read. They helped show how each part of the system connected together, which made it easier for both technical and nontechnical people to understand the design.



### 3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part, I’d work on improving the System Design Document (SDD) by adding more technical details. For example, I would include stronger security explanations, like how data encryption and role-based access control would work. These additions would make the document more realistic and help show how the design follows secure coding practices (OWASP Foundation, 2024).



### 4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
I carefully looked at what each user needed—students, instructors, and administrators—and designed features that solved their problems. Students needed easy scheduling and progress tracking, so I added automated lesson booking and dashboard features. Instructors needed tools for managing calendars, while administrators needed ways to handle reports and packages. Understanding user needs helped me design a system that felt practical and user-friendly (Interaction Design Foundation, 2023).



### 5. Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It’s important to consider user needs because they are the people who will actually use the system. If the design doesn’t fit what users expect, it can lead to confusion and frustration. Building around the user’s perspective helps make the software easier to use, saves time during development, and avoids costly redesigns later (Pressman & Maxim, 2020). A good design always focuses on solving real problems for real people.



### 6. How do you approach designing software?
When I design software, I like to take a step-by-step approach. I start by collecting requirements, then I use diagrams to map out how the system should work. I also like to get feedback early before moving too far ahead, which helps avoid mistakes. I try to follow the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) so that each stage—analysis, design, and validation—builds on the one before it.



### 7. What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the future, I plan to use techniques like prototyping, user story mapping, and agile modeling. These strategies help teams stay flexible and make it easier to adjust when requirements change. I also plan to keep practicing with UML and other modeling tools so that I can clearly show how systems work before development begins.



### 8. Closing Reflection
Working on the DriverPass project helped me connect what I’ve learned about system analysis and design to a real-world scenario. I gained confidence in gathering requirements, creating diagrams, and explaining technical ideas in simple terms. This experience has helped me grow as a student and as a future systems analyst.
